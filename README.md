#Welcome to the Level 3 BTEC in Engineering
<p>
This is your hand book for the course and contains information about the course, assessment structure and general information as well as engineering data and equations which you can refer to as you progress through the course.

#The Course
<p> 
The course is for two years and is equivalent to three 'A' levels and is widely accepted by universities. It is currently made up of 18 units and you will do nine in each year. 
It can be converted from 120 to 420 UCAS points depending on your grades throughout the course. 

##First Year Units

##Second Year Units 

##Assesment 
<p> 
All assessment is assignment based, each unit typically comprising four assignments. Over those assignments you will have the opportunity to achieve all of the criteria for that unit.
<p> 
The criteria are broken down into PASS, MERIT & DISTINCTION. In order to achieve a distinction for a unit all the distinction, merit and pass criteria must be achieved. In order to achieve a merit all merit and pass criteria must be achieved and in order to pass the course ALL pass criteria must be achieved. 

##Trigonometry 
For right angled triangles: 
$$Sin\theta =\frac{opp}{hyp}$$
$$Cos\theta =\frac{adj}{hyp}$$ 
$$Tan\theta =\frac{opp}{adj}$$ 

For non right angle triangles:
###Sine Rule 
$$\frac{a}{sinA}=\frac{b}{sinB}=\frac{c}{sinC}$$
###Cosine Rule 
$$CosA=\frac{b^2+c^2-a^2}{2bc}$$ 
$$CosB=\frac{a^2+c^2-b^2}{2ac}$$
$$CosC=\frac{a^2+b^2-c^2}{2ab}$$ 

##Statics 
###D'Alembert 
$$F_{1}+F_{2}=0$$

###Moments 
####For equilibrium 
Clockwise| = | Anticlockwise
------------- | ------------- |---------------
$$f_1s_1$$ | = | $$f_2s_2$$ 
####Density 
$$\displaystyle \rho =\frac{m}{V}$$
####Kinetic Energy 
$$\displaystyle\frac{1}{2}mv^2$$
####Potential Energy 
$$\displaystyle mgh$$
####Stress 
$$\displaystyle \sigma =\frac{F}{A}$$ 
####Strain 
$$\displaystyle \epsilon =\frac{x}{l}$$ 
Can also be written as; 
$$\displaystyle \epsilon =\frac{\Delta l}{l}$$
####Young's Modulus 
$$\displaystyle E=\frac{\sigma}{\epsilon}$$
###Areas 
####Circle 
$$\displaystyle \pi r^2$$ 
or 
$$\displaystyle \frac{\pi d^2}{4}$$

####Triangle 
$$\frac{\text{base} \times \text{height}}{2}$$
